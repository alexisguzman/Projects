# Attendance Tracker

This program is a simple, but very useful attendance tracker that allows professors
or TAs to mark students absent and record the dates automatically. If a mistake
is committed, the user can go back and fix it with the Edit Absences feature.
This program is achieved by creating a main class representing a student and
what I would consider a secondary class such as the list of a class which points 
to a list of student classes. A tertiary but important class would be the class
representing the stack of absences which allows for easy access to last absence.
