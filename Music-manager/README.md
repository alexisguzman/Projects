This is a music manager simulator.


This project reads song titles from an existing .csv file named musicPlayList.csv. The titles and their respective information are stored into a doubly linked list that is initially in the order that it's read from the file, but can be sorted in alphabetical order, by artist or title, and by rating, which is performed by bubble sorting. Music playing can also be simulated, though when a song "plays", the title and its information are simply displayed to the screen for a few seconds. As you go, you can insert titles and specific information about them, and can update your .csv file if needed.
