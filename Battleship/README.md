# Battleship Simulator

This program simulates battleship by using a two-dimensional array. It is 
designed for only one player, as the opponent is the computer. The user can
choose to place their ships manually or can have them placed randomly.
As the game goes on, the outcome of each turn is recorded into "battleship.log", 
whether it's a hit, a miss, or sinking a ship. The final statistics for each 
player are also recorded at the end of the game.
